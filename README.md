Description: 
For this homework I took the progressive budget app and added functionality so that the webpage's resources would be added to the cache on page load and called up if the page was loaded in offline mode, and entries could be made to the database and inserted when going back online. The db.js file was provided by the class instructor due to time constraints, which is also reflected in the file. For the service-worker.js file, I followed the convention of the service worker created in the Notetaker Activity (14).
